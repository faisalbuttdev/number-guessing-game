# Number Guessing Game

A simple **CLI-based Number Guessing Game** written in **Go**, featuring multiple difficulty levels, a live timer, and highscore tracking.

This project is designed to demonstrate Go concepts like **structs, maps, slices, goroutines, and channels** in a fun, interactive way.
